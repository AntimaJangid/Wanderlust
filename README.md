# 🌐 Wanderlust

 It is a robust and modular web application built using modern JavaScript technologies including **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. The project is designed to serve as a solid foundation for developing scalable and maintainable server-side applications, with integrated cloud-based media handling and custom middleware capabilities.

## 📖 Project Description

At its core, it acts as a backend server for a dynamic web application. It establishes a clean and organized project structure where each responsibility is clearly separated—ranging from server configuration and middleware logic to cloud services and data modeling.

### 🧠 Architecture Overview

- **Express.js Application**: Acts as the HTTP server, handling routing, middleware application, and request-response cycles.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Manages file storage and image handling through a cloud provider, abstracted in the `cloudConfig.js` module.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `dotenv` to securely manage sensitive environment variables such as API keys and database URIs.
- **MongoDB Schema**: Defines structured data models for MongoDB using Mongoose or a similar library via `schema.js`.
- **Custom Middleware**: Centralizes request validation, error handling, and other intermediate logic in `middleware.js`.

### 📂 Core Files

- `app.js`: Main entry point of the application, setting up middleware, routes, and server start logic.
- `cloudConfig.js`: Contains the setup for Cloudinary, enabling secure media upload and retrieval.
- `middleware.js`: Houses reusable middleware functions to be used across various routes and request types.
- `schema.js`: Defines data models that represent and enforce the structure of documents in the database.

### ⚙️ Best Practices Followed

- Follows environment-based development, separating sensitive data into a `.env` file.
- Implements modular design principles for maintainability and scalability.
- Includes a `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive or unnecessary files such as `node_modules/` and `.env`.
- Organized with version control using Git, aiding in collaborative and trackable development.
